## Show Notes

TIL: It's "Opa" as in "Opa!" when you go to a Greek restaurant, not "Oh P Aye"

Notes from Torin:
> I recommend getting started with the Kubernetes admission control tutorial on openpolicyagent.org: https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/kubernetes-admission-control.html. The tutorial takes you through deploying OPA from scratch, enabling the webhook, deploying a policy, exercising the policy, updating the policy, etc. This is how most people try out OPA for admission control for the first time.
>
> In addition to the tutorial, we recently put together a primer/guide on writing admission control policies: https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/blob/master/docs/content/docs/guides-kubernetes-admission-control.md. The guide goes into detail on how admission control policies are structured and evaluated.
>
> A couple other pointers that might be helpful:
>
> * [Language Reference](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/language-reference.html). This page lists all the various built-in functions for things like string manipulation, regexp, etc.
>
> * [Rego Cheatsheet](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/blob/master/docs/content/docs/rego-cheatsheet.md). Compact reference doc for common expressions in OPA (e.g., looking up values, iterating over arrays, etc.)
>
> Lastly, when it comes to writing Rego, you could check out the [VS Code extension](https://github.com/tsandall/vscode-opa) and [play.openpolicyagent.org](https://play.openpolicyagent.org/). Both provide ability to evaluate the policies interactively.
>
> As far as Gatekeeper goes, we're in the middle of restructuring the controller quite a bit and we don't have the same kind of docs yet. The policy authoring experience is more or less the same in Gatekeeper (i.e., users write `deny` rules that enforce constraints on `input` which gets bound to the AdmissionReview object.) Once Gatekeeper is ready, there will be additional features like a constraint library and audit capability that might be good fodder for a future episode :D
