## Show Notes

[LinkerD Getting Started](https://linkerd.io/2/getting-started/index.html)
[CLI Installation](https://linkerd.io/2/getting-started/#step-1-install-the-cli) - as usual we recommend inspecting any .sh file that you curl to install something.
Things learned from Linkerd devs in chat:
 - CLI client and control plane is golang
 - Data plane is in rust (this is new)
`linkerd install` doesn't do anything, it outputs a yaml file for you. So no dep on helm or other tools, just the raw yaml. You then pipe this to a file and/or kubectl. install takes some flags for versions, etc.

Checking the yaml file (~854 lines.)
- Controllers are read-only, no reading of secrets. (We like to see things like this)
- Not running as root (user 2102) in SecurityContext
    - upstream k8s will start to enforce things like this soon, openshift already does this.
