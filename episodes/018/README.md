### Show notes

> This week we will be exploring the kube-metacontroller project from Anthony Yeh at Google.  This is a framework that makes it super easy to create controllers and is something that was highlighted in a KubeCon keynote. As this is the first episode after KubeCon I'll also share my impressions of what I saw there.
