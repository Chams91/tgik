## Last week in Kubernetes Development (lwkd.info)
- [New scope doc in github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/architecture/scope.md)
- [The documentation for HTTP readiness and liveness probes has always said that any HTTP response with a code between 200 and 400 would be considered a success, but until now 301 and 302 redirects have been expanded by the kubelet and queried again. As a compromise between matching the spec and not overly breaking backwards compatibility, redirects to the same hostname as used originally will still be followed, but a redirect to a new hostname will be considered a success and not followed. This may result in a loss of accuracy in some very rare cases such as clustered applications redirecting to each other. But on the plus side it improves the security of Kubernetes and closes a potential traffic amplification vector.](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/75416)

### About Gloo

Built on envoy. Great quote below.



###### Patrick Barker [10:51 AM]
> so the tldr on gloo: you know how istio, ambassador, contour, etc are all just ways of configuring envoy on kubernetes? Gloo decomposed that process down into more fundamental types https://gloo.solo.io/dev/ making it really a way to build envoy configuration services.
