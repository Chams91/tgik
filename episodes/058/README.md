What is Firecracker?

Micro VM - virtual machine manager 
- [Announcement Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/firecracker-lightweight-virtualization-for-serverless-computing/)
- [Firecracker Homepage](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/)
- [Github Repo](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker)
- [Announcement Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=femopq3JWJg)
- [Firecracker Katacoda](https://www.katacoda.com/firecracker-microvm/scenarios/getting-started)

Leverages KVM, driven my QEMU, written in Rust. (GCE VMM is C++ back from when Joe worked on it). 
These are the only 4 devices (virtio net / virtio block / 1-pin of i8042, and UART). eg. no GPU support.
Firecracker is ~40k lines of code, including the auto-generated system call bindings. 
Most importantly, the logo has 7 sides, so it's clearly designed for Kubernetes
