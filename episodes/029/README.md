> Deploying applications to Kubernetes is one thing. But what about developing on Kubernetes How do you use Kubernetes to run your application in an environment that is similar to production? This is a super active space with a lot of interesting tools including things like Draft or newer projects like Skaffold.  In this episode we'll start to break down ways to approach this problem and look at a tool called ksync from vapor.io.
