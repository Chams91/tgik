### Show notes

> This week we will look at Nuclio -- a serverless system that is aimed at real time and data driven applications.  How does this compare with some of the other serverless systems out there? What makes it for "real time and data driven apps"?  How does it work when I try to install on a k8s cluster that they don't have explicit instructions around?
