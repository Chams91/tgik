# Episode 056 : Heptio Contour and IngressRoute

- Hosted by @jbeda
- Recording date: 2018-11-02

Heptio Contour is an "ingress controller" that uses Kubernetes objects to configure Envoy.
With Contour v0.6 and v0.7, it has introduced a new CRD called the "IngressRoute".
We are going to dig into what this is, how it works and why Contour went this direction.

## Swag!

We will pick a random 7 people who submit to https://j.hept.io/tgik-roll-call and send them some fun swag!  You'll need the secret password from watching the video.  We'll take everyone that submits up to 72 hours from airing.

## Show Notes

- 00:22 Load Balancers and Ingress
- Network traffic comes the user, goes to a software load balancer, say ELB.
- ELB routes into a software load balancer in your cluster, say nginx.
    - 00:34 Question from the audience: Is there a performance hit? In AWS the NLB is transparent to the network.
- nginx picks a service in a cluster to route traffic to. If you say foo.com, go to service 1. That service is considered the _upstream_. It's very confusing. "Down is upstream"
- 00:29 Limitations in Ingress protecting namespaces from stepping on each other
- 00:31 Clarifying what we mean by upstream
- 00:34 Installing Contour
    - [Deploying on AWS with NLB](https://github.com/heptio/contour/blob/master/docs/deploy-aws-nlb.md)
    - [Documentation](https://github.com/heptio/contour/tree/master/docs)
- 00:37 Investigating the yaml we use to install Contour
    - Pro tip to new listeners: Joe will typically spend time going through yaml files before deployment to see exactly what something does on your cluster before applying. Good habit to get in to!
- 00:50 We're up and running!
