## Notes from Microsofties

Shoutout to [@ralph_squillace](https://twitter.com/ralph_squillace) and [@michellenoorali](https://twitter.com/michellenoorali)

The goal of the spec is to describe "How" and installation is going to happen with multiple "Components" regardless of runtime / state management stack. 

###### Note: Multiple invocation images

Not currently working in duffle, but working on fleshing this out.
